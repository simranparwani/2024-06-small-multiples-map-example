# Small multiples map - Svelte example

This was a map created for the Axios story [Charted: Abortion travel distances, two years after Dobbs](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/24/abortion-travel-distances-200-miles-post-roe).
This repo contains the app.svelte file and two relevant components. To see how to make your own project in Svelte, check out the very handy tutorial in the [Svelte documentation site](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte).
Data was pulled from the [Myers Abortion Facility Database](https://osf.io/8dg7r/)
The color palette steps were created using the invaluable [chroma.js tool](https://gka.github.io/palettes).

In June 2024, there have been 14 states that have banned nearly all abortions since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. The June 2024 map shows how driving distances have significantly increased for states in the southern U.S. with the most affected counties in Texas and Louisiana now having to drive over 700 miles to the nearest provider." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b37447f0-a93b-48eb-896f-e4caacaebb0f">
